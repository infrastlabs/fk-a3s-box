# Changelog

All notable changes to A3S Box will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Registry mirrors: `A3S_REGISTRY_MIRRORS=host=mirror,...` pulls image content
  from a configured mirror while preserving the canonical image identity in the
  store (e.g. fetch `registry.k8s.io`/`gcr.io` images via an accessible mirror).
- CRI `SecurityContext.no_new_privs`: the guest sets `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`
  before exec, so a setuid/setgid or file-capability binary can no longer raise
  the container process's privileges (privileged containers opt out).
- CRI `SecurityContext.readonly_rootfs`: the guest remounts the container root
  read-only before exec (writes to `/` fail), while `/proc`, `/sys`, and inner
  mounts stay writable.
- CRI pod DNS config: a pod's `DNSConfig` (servers, searches, options) is
  captured on the sandbox and rendered into each container's `/etc/resolv.conf`
  (falling back to the default when unset).
- Image-defined supplemental groups: when a container runs as a specific user,
  the guest applies the groups that user belongs to per the image's `/etc/group`
  (runc-style initgroups) and defaults the primary gid to the user's
  `/etc/passwd` group when no `RunAsGroup` is set.

### Security
- Non-privileged containers are now restricted to the runtime default
  capability set (e.g. no `CAP_NET_ADMIN`/`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`), adjusted by the
  container's `add`/`drop` capabilities; privileged containers keep the full
  set. Previously every container ran as full-capability root, so a
  non-privileged container could perform privileged operations (e.g. create a
  network bridge). The guest applies an exact keep-set via `capset` + bounding
  drop before exec.

### Fixed
- The container log file is now created eagerly at `StartContainer` (instead of
  lazily when the first output arrives), so a caller that opens the log
  immediately after start — e.g. `ReopenContainerLog`, or before the container
  has produced any output — finds it. Fixes the critest "reopening container
  log" conformance spec.
- CRI image identity now follows the digest, matching real runtimes:
  - `ListImages`/`ImageStatus` coalesce references by content digest, so an
    image with multiple tags appears once with all `repo_tags`.
  - `ImageStatus` resolves an image by exact reference, image id (digest), a
    `name@sha256:...` digest pin, or an unnormalized name (e.g. a tagless name
    defaulting to `:latest`).
  - `RemoveImage` accepts an image id (digest), not just a tag/reference.
  - `PullImage` returns the content digest as `image_ref`, so different tags of
    the same image dedupe to one image id.
  - An image pulled by digest (`repo@sha256:...`) is reported with that
    reference as a `repo_digest` and empty `repo_tags` (digest pins have no tag).
  - `ImageStatus`/`ListImages` surface the image's configured user as `uid`
    (numeric `uid`/`uid:gid`) or `username` (named user), from the OCI config.
  - `CreateContainer` resolves the image the same way (exact ref, digest id,
    `name@sha256:` pin, or unnormalized name), via a shared `ImageStore::resolve`
    — so a container referencing an image by an untagged name now starts.
  - The full critest Image Manager conformance suite now passes (7/7): public
    image pull/remove by tag, without tag, and by digest; image status across
    all reference kinds; non-empty uid/username; and the listImage image and
    repoTag counts.

## [2.0.6] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- CRI Linux SecurityContext: `RunAsUser`/`RunAsGroup`/`RunAsUserName` (passwd
  lookup), `SupplementalGroups` (setgroups), `MaskedPaths`/`ReadonlyPaths`, and
  the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile (default BPF filter → `Seccomp: 2`).
- `/proc` and `/sys` are now mounted inside the container chroot, so in-container
  reads of `/proc/self/*` and `/sys/class/*` work like any container runtime.
- Pod sysctls: safe sysctls from `PodSandboxConfig` are applied in the guest at
  VM boot.
- Writable CRI volume mounts (materialized by copy into the rootfs; read-only
  and host-path-symlink volumes included).
- Graceful shutdown: on SIGTERM/SIGINT the CRI reaps every sandbox VM and
  unmounts its overlay, so microVMs/overlays no longer orphan across restarts.

### Fixed
- Corrected the CRI v1 `LinuxContainerSecurityContext` proto field numbers to the
  official spec (kubelet/critest can now decode security-context pods).
- `RemoveContainer` force-removes a running container (stops it first), per the
  CRI contract.
- Security & safety hardening from an adversarial code review (16 confirmed
  findings): a container image/pod env can no longer spoof the `A3S_SEC_*`
  security envelope (privilege escalation); the seccomp BPF filter is built
  before `fork` (no async-signal-unsafe allocation in the post-fork child —
  a musl malloc-deadlock risk); MaskedPaths/ReadonlyPaths mounts are idempotent
  (no per-exec mount leak); MaskedPaths/ReadonlyPaths/sysctl names are
  path-traversal validated; plus panic/leak/non-Linux-build fixes.
- `ReopenContainerLog` is now synchronous (waits for the supervisor to reopen the
  log) — correct CRI semantics for log rotation.

### Conformance
- `critest` v1.30.1: 44 of 82 runnable specs pass (up from 21), with no
  regressions. Remaining failures are environmental (registry egress),
  guest-kernel-limited (bridge/mqueue/AppArmor), architectural (mount
  propagation), or test-image artifacts — see `docs/cri-conformance.md`.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- CRI `exec` works end to end over the Kubernetes SPDY/3.1 `remotecommand`
  protocol — `kubectl exec` / `crictl exec` (non-TTY and TTY), stdin, stdout,
  stderr, and exit-code propagation. Implemented in `cri/src/spdy.rs`; the two
  critest exec conformance specs now pass.

### Fixed
- CRI server is now reachable by standard gRPC clients (`crictl`, the kubelet,
  `critest`) over its Unix domain socket. `grpc-go >= 1.57` sends the
  percent-encoded socket path as the HTTP/2 `:authority`, which upstream `h2`
  rejected with a `PROTOCOL_ERROR` stream reset before any CRI RPC ran. A
  vendored `h2` patch (`third_party/h2`, wired via `[patch.crates-io]`) relaxes
  authority validation for UDS-style values; the full pod+container lifecycle
  (`runp`/`create`/`start`/`ps`/`stop`/`rm`/`stopp`/`rmp`) now works end to end.

### Changed
- Split the 7732-line `cri/src/runtime_service.rs` into a focused
  `runtime_service/` module (no behavior change).

## [2.0.4] — 2026-05-09

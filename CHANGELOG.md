# Changelog

All notable changes to A3S Box will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.7] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Container log stream tagging**: `logs` now distinguishes a container's
  stdout from stderr (Docker json-file `stream` field), via libkrun's 3-fd
  split virtio-console (guest stdout → `console.log`, stderr →
  `console.err.log`). Foreground `run`/`attach` send the container's stdout to
  the terminal's stdout and stderr to its stderr; `logs` routes stderr lines to
  its stderr.

### Fixed
- **Container logs are now complete and correct.** The log processor moved from
  the ephemeral launching CLI into the shim (the box's lifetime process), so a
  detached `run -d` box no longer truncates its logs when the CLI exits — this
  also gives `--timestamps` real per-line emission times. The processor tails
  `console.log` like `tail -f` (it previously stopped at the first EOF, dropping
  lines a container logged after a quiet period). Runtime internals (guest-init
  tracing → `/dev/kmsg`; libkrun's `init.krun:` preamble filtered) are kept out
  of container logs.
- A box without `--rm` now survives its stop like a Docker stopped container —
  it keeps its dir and logs (so `logs`/`start` work afterwards) until `rm`.
- Single-file bind mount (`-v /host/file:/container/file`) no longer clobbers
  the target's parent directory.
- A rebuilt or re-tagged image becomes a prunable `<none>` dangling image
  instead of silently orphaning its on-disk layout (a disk leak); `images`
  renders it as `<none> <none>`.
- `-p 0:<container>` / `-p 0` now resolves to a real free host port.
- Named `--user` / `exec -u` is resolved inside the guest; `inspect` returns a
  JSON array with a Docker-shaped `State`; image-management parity (`inspect`
  array, `rmi` by short id / `--force`, `commit --change`, `tag` validation);
  `volume rm` exit code + `volume inspect` schema; `cp` mode + large-file.

### Added
- Registry mirrors: `A3S_REGISTRY_MIRRORS=host=mirror,...` pulls image content
  from a configured mirror while preserving the canonical image identity in the
  store (e.g. fetch `registry.k8s.io`/`gcr.io` images via an accessible mirror).
- CRI `SecurityContext.no_new_privs`: the guest sets `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`
  before exec, so a setuid/setgid or file-capability binary can no longer raise
  the container process's privileges (privileged containers opt out).
- CRI `SecurityContext.readonly_rootfs`: the guest remounts the container root
  read-only before exec (writes to `/` fail), while `/proc`, `/sys`, and inner
  mounts stay writable.
- CRI pod DNS config: a pod's `DNSConfig` (servers, searches, options) is
  captured on the sandbox and rendered into each container's `/etc/resolv.conf`
  (falling back to the default when unset).
- Image-defined supplemental groups: when a container runs as a specific user,
  the guest applies the groups that user belongs to per the image's `/etc/group`
  (runc-style initgroups) and defaults the primary gid to the user's
  `/etc/passwd` group when no `RunAsGroup` is set.
- `import` creates a single-layer image from a rootfs tarball (`.tar`/`.tar.gz`),
  with Dockerfile-style `--change` directives (CMD/ENTRYPOINT/ENV/WORKDIR/USER/
  EXPOSE/LABEL/VOLUME) and `--message` — matching `docker import`.
- `images --filter` supports `reference=<glob>` and `label=<key>[=<value>]`
  (repeatable; all must match), matching common `docker images --filter` usage.
- `build --target <stage>` builds only up to the named (or indexed) stage of a
  multi-stage build and emits that stage's image; later stages are not executed.
- `build --no-cache` disables the layer build cache so every layer is rebuilt.
- `inspect <name>` is now polymorphic: it resolves a container first, then falls
  back to an image (matching `docker inspect`), instead of only handling boxes.
- `ADD --chown=user[:group]` is now supported (was "not supported yet").
- COPY/ADD `--chown` now also resolves named users/groups from the rootfs
  `/etc/passwd`/`/etc/group`, not only numeric IDs.
- `.dockerignore` support: a context-root `.dockerignore` now excludes matching
  paths from `COPY`/`ADD` (comments, blank lines, `!` negation with last-match-
  wins, and `?`/`*`/`**` globs). Previously `COPY . /app` copied everything —
  `.git`, `node_modules`, `.env` secrets — into the image; those are now kept
  out, matching Docker. (Applies to the build context, not `COPY --from`.)
- Layer-level build cache (Docker/BuildKit-style): `a3s-box build` reuses
  previously built layers across builds via a rolling chain key over each
  instruction (and, for `COPY`/`ADD`, the content of the source files), so an
  unchanged prefix is reused and a changed instruction/input rebuilds from that
  layer on. Cached at `~/.a3s/buildcache`, size-capped (default 2 GiB,
  `A3S_BOX_BUILDCACHE_MAX_BYTES`; oldest evicted first), best-effort.
- CRI `ReopenContainerLog` flush boundary: log rotation now asks the guest to
  flush and drains every buffered output chunk into the old log file (stopping
  at a flush-ack marker added to the exec protocol) before reopening, so output
  produced before the rotation cannot leak into the new file.
- `network prune` removes all networks not used by at least one box, and
  `system prune` now reaps unused networks too (matching `docker network prune`
  and `docker system prune`). A network is kept while it has a live endpoint or
  any box record (running or stopped) references it; predefined `bridge`/`host`/
  `none` are never pruned.

### Security
- Host network/IPC namespaces are now rejected fail-closed: a pod or container
  requesting `HostNetwork`/`HostIpc` (or a host user namespace) —
  `NamespaceMode::NODE` — gets a clear `Unimplemented` error instead of being
  silently run fully isolated. A microVM-per-pod has no host network or IPC
  namespace inside the guest, so silently accepting gave the workload wrong
  (fail-open) semantics. `HostPID` is accepted (the pod's shared VM-wide PID
  namespace satisfies it), as are `POD`/`CONTAINER`.
- AppArmor: a requested Localhost profile (modern `apparmor` SecurityProfile or
  the deprecated `apparmor_profile` string) is now validated against the host's
  loaded profiles and the container is rejected when the profile is not loaded,
  instead of being silently ignored. The microVM cannot enforce an in-guest LSM
  profile, so a loaded profile is accepted with a warning that it is not
  enforced. Passes critest "should fail with an unloaded profile".
- Non-privileged containers are now restricted to the runtime default
  capability set (e.g. no `CAP_NET_ADMIN`/`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`), adjusted by the
  container's `add`/`drop` capabilities; privileged containers keep the full
  set. Previously every container ran as full-capability root, so a
  non-privileged container could perform privileged operations (e.g. create a
  network bridge). The guest applies an exact keep-set via `capset` + bounding
  drop before exec.

### Added
- Pod port reachability: a port mapping with only a container port now publishes
  it on the same host port (Docker/containerd style), and a default (TSI) pod
  that publishes ports reports `127.0.0.1` as its pod IP — TSI binds
  `0.0.0.0:<port>` and forwards to the guest, so `podIP:<containerPort>` is
  genuinely reachable from the node. Passes the port-mapping and
  multi-container networking conformance specs. (Single-node reachability via
  the node loopback; not a unique cluster-routable pod IP, and concurrent pods
  publishing the same port still contend for the host port.)
- Crash recovery: on startup the CRI reaps sandbox microVMs orphaned by a
  previous crash/SIGKILL — it kills the leftover `a3s-box-shim` (matched by the
  box id in its argv), unmounts its overlay, and removes its box directory —
  instead of leaking the VM, mount, and disk across restarts. A graceful
  shutdown already reaps VMs, so this is a no-op then.

### Added
- Compose `depends_on` supports `condition: service_completed_successfully`:
  a dependent waits for its dependency to run to completion (exit 0) before
  starting. Previously this condition was rejected at config time.

### Fixed
- Docker build/runtime parity (found via a 51-case real-Linux probe):
  - Compose services resolve each other by their bare service name (e.g.
    `getent hosts db`), not only by the `{project}-{service}` box name —
    matching Docker Compose service discovery. Network endpoints carry DNS
    aliases that are written into peers' `/etc/hosts`.
  - `COPY --chown` ownership is now honored at runtime. The layer tar headers
    were stamped correctly, but the rootfs the container saw collapsed to root
    (`stat` reported `0:0`): layer extraction did not set `preserve_ownerships`
    and the overlay/rootfs-cache copy carried content/permissions but not
    uid/gid. Both paths now restore the layer uid/gid (root only), so
    `COPY --chown=4242:4343` shows `4242:4343` and `--chown=nobody` shows
    `65534:65534`; non-root ownership baked into base images is preserved too.
  - A relative `--workdir` (e.g. `-w sub`) is accepted and resolved against the
    image WORKDIR (`/srv/app` + `sub` => `/srv/app/sub`), matching Docker;
    previously any non-absolute workdir was rejected.
  - Build-time variable expansion now matches Docker: a later `ENV` value and
    `WORKDIR` expand earlier `ENV`/`ARG` (e.g. `ENV APPDIR=/srv/app` then
    `WORKDIR $APPDIR`), instead of keeping the literal `$APPDIR`. An undeclared
    `--build-arg` (no matching `ARG`) is no longer substituted, and a global
    pre-FROM `ARG` is now in scope for every stage's `FROM` and body (so
    `FROM alpine:$BASETAG` in a later stage resolves).
  - `COPY`/`ADD` expand wildcard sources (`COPY *.conf /etc/`) against the
    build context instead of failing "source not found"; a glob matching
    nothing errors like Docker. Remote `ADD` URLs are never globbed.
  - `LABEL a=1 b=2 c=3` and `EXPOSE 80 443 8080/udp` on one line now parse every
    item (previously LABEL merged into one key and EXPOSE kept only the first
    port); bare EXPOSE ports normalize to `<port>/tcp`.
  - `HEALTHCHECK --interval=1m30s` (Go compound durations) is accepted instead of
    erroring "Invalid duration".
  - `MAINTAINER` is accepted as deprecated-but-valid (builds, recorded as a
    `maintainer` label) instead of failing the build.
  - `--env-file` values are kept verbatim after the first `=` (Docker preserves
    `PADDED=  x  `); previously the value was whitespace-trimmed.
  - Runtime bare `-e KEY` (no `=`) copies `KEY` from the host environment
    (Docker passthrough) instead of erroring; `--label`/`--log-opt` stay strict.
- Short-lived `run` no longer stalls ~10s before returning. A container that
  exits quickly (e.g. `run alpine -- echo hi`) made the VM halt and the shim
  become a zombie; the boot-readiness wait checked liveness with `kill(pid,0)`,
  which reports a zombie as alive, so it waited the full exec-heartbeat timeout
  (~10s, intermittently, depending on a boot race). Readiness now uses a
  zombie-aware liveness check (`/proc` state on Linux) and returns promptly
  (~1.7s). Also speeds up the monitor restarting fast-exiting containers.
- `run`/`create` health flags accept Docker-style duration strings:
  `--health-interval 30s`, `--health-timeout 1m`, `--health-start-period 10s`
  (and compounds like `1m30s`) instead of only a bare integer, which was
  rejected with "invalid digit found in string". A bare number still means
  seconds, so existing usage is unchanged. (The Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` and
  compose-YAML paths already parsed durations.)
- `RUN chmod` (mode-only changes) are now captured into the build layer, so
  the common `COPY script.sh` + `RUN chmod +x script.sh` makes the script
  executable in the image (previously the chmod was dropped and the script
  could not be run as the entrypoint).
- `--read-only` no longer crashes the container: a direct read-only remount of
  the virtio-fs root can fail with EBUSY, which was fatal to init. It now falls
  back to a bind-remount and, if that also fails, logs a warning and runs the
  container writable instead of killing it.
- Multi-variable `ENV KEY1=V1 KEY2=V2` (several pairs on one line) was parsed
  as a single variable swallowing the rest (`KEY1="V1 KEY2=V2"`), so only the
  first key got set and downstream `$KEY2` expanded empty. ENV now parses all
  pairs (quote-aware, so `KEY="a b" K2=c` stays two vars). Single and legacy
  `ENV KEY VALUE` forms are unchanged.
- Image `USER` (named or numeric) and `run --user` are now applied to the
  container MAIN process, by the guest init right before exec (setgroups +
  setgid + setuid, after PID 1 finishes its root-only setup), reusing the same
  resolver the exec path uses (names via the image /etc/passwd, image
  supplementary groups). Previously this went through the shim's libkrun
  set_uid, which dropped the guest PID 1 to that user and could not work at all:
  a named USER was silently skipped (ran as root) and a numeric one crashed the
  container. Now `USER appuser` runs the process as appuser.
- `save`/`load` now round-trip the image tag: `save` stamps the image reference
  into the OCI `index.json` `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name` annotation, so
  `load` restores the tag (e.g. `rt:9`) instead of importing the image untagged
  (by digest only). `load` already read the annotation; `save` never wrote it.
- Image references with a purely numeric tag and no registry (`redis:7`,
  `node:18`, `postgres:16`, `ubuntu:24`) were mis-parsed: the numeric tag was
  treated as a registry port and dropped, so the reference resolved to the
  `:latest` tag instead. A colon with no `/` is always a tag (a bare
  `registry:port` with no repository is not a valid reference), so numeric tags
  now parse correctly — affecting pull, run, and `images` display.
- `COPY`/`ADD` now preserve symlinks instead of following them: a copied symlink
  (e.g. a shared library `libfoo.so -> libfoo.so.1`, or any `node_modules`/
  `/usr/lib` link) was dereferenced into a duplicate regular file, losing the
  link and bloating the image. Symlinks (including symlink-to-dir and dangling
  links) are now stored as symlink layer entries, matching Docker.
- Multi-stage `COPY --from=<stage> /abs/path` (and any absolute COPY/ADD source)
  was broken: the absolute source was resolved against the host root instead of
  the source stage's rootfs (`Path::join` discards the base for an absolute
  argument), failing with "source not found". Absolute sources are now resolved
  relative to the context/stage, so multi-stage builds work.
- Multi-layer image corruption in `a3s-box build`: layer digest and size were
  computed before the gzip stream was flushed to disk (the tar builder owning
  the encoder was dropped only at function end), so every layer recorded the
  same digest — the hash of the partial 10-byte gzip header — and `size` 10.
  Manifests referenced one wrong digest for every layer and the content-addressed
  blob store collapsed all layers into the first; single-layer images happened
  to round-trip, hiding the bug. The encoder is now finished before hashing.
- Container `/dev` now contains the standard device nodes (`null`, `zero`,
  `full`, `random`, `urandom`, `tty`), created in the guest before the container
  starts. Workloads that need them — e.g. Apache httpd, which reads
  `/dev/urandom` to seed its RNG and otherwise aborts with `AH00141` — now run.
  Fixes the multi-container exec/log conformance specs.
- The container log file is now created eagerly at `StartContainer` (instead of
  lazily when the first output arrives), so a caller that opens the log
  immediately after start — e.g. `ReopenContainerLog`, or before the container
  has produced any output — finds it. Fixes the critest "reopening container
  log" conformance spec.
- CRI image identity now follows the digest, matching real runtimes:
  - `ListImages`/`ImageStatus` coalesce references by content digest, so an
    image with multiple tags appears once with all `repo_tags`.
  - `ImageStatus` resolves an image by exact reference, image id (digest), a
    `name@sha256:...` digest pin, or an unnormalized name (e.g. a tagless name
    defaulting to `:latest`).
  - `RemoveImage` accepts an image id (digest), not just a tag/reference.
  - `PullImage` returns the content digest as `image_ref`, so different tags of
    the same image dedupe to one image id.
  - An image pulled by digest (`repo@sha256:...`) is reported with that
    reference as a `repo_digest` and empty `repo_tags` (digest pins have no tag).
  - `ImageStatus`/`ListImages` surface the image's configured user as `uid`
    (numeric `uid`/`uid:gid`) or `username` (named user), from the OCI config.
  - `CreateContainer` resolves the image the same way (exact ref, digest id,
    `name@sha256:` pin, or unnormalized name), via a shared `ImageStore::resolve`
    — so a container referencing an image by an untagged name now starts.
  - The full critest Image Manager conformance suite now passes (7/7): public
    image pull/remove by tag, without tag, and by digest; image status across
    all reference kinds; non-empty uid/username; and the listImage image and
    repoTag counts.
- `stop` now stops containers gracefully and honors the image `STOPSIGNAL`. The
  CLI signalled the shim directly, but libkrun renames the shim and a host
  signal kills the VM abruptly, so the container never ran its stop handler —
  a `STOPSIGNAL SIGINT` image, or even a plain SIGTERM trap, was ignored. The
  stop signal is now delivered inside the guest over the exec channel (a
  `signal-main` control to the container's main process); the container runs its
  own shutdown and exits, then guest init exits and the VM halts cleanly. A
  container that ignores the signal is still force-killed at the stop timeout.

## [2.0.6] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- CRI Linux SecurityContext: `RunAsUser`/`RunAsGroup`/`RunAsUserName` (passwd
  lookup), `SupplementalGroups` (setgroups), `MaskedPaths`/`ReadonlyPaths`, and
  the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile (default BPF filter → `Seccomp: 2`).
- `/proc` and `/sys` are now mounted inside the container chroot, so in-container
  reads of `/proc/self/*` and `/sys/class/*` work like any container runtime.
- Pod sysctls: safe sysctls from `PodSandboxConfig` are applied in the guest at
  VM boot.
- Writable CRI volume mounts (materialized by copy into the rootfs; read-only
  and host-path-symlink volumes included).
- Graceful shutdown: on SIGTERM/SIGINT the CRI reaps every sandbox VM and
  unmounts its overlay, so microVMs/overlays no longer orphan across restarts.

### Fixed
- Corrected the CRI v1 `LinuxContainerSecurityContext` proto field numbers to the
  official spec (kubelet/critest can now decode security-context pods).
- `RemoveContainer` force-removes a running container (stops it first), per the
  CRI contract.
- Security & safety hardening from an adversarial code review (16 confirmed
  findings): a container image/pod env can no longer spoof the `A3S_SEC_*`
  security envelope (privilege escalation); the seccomp BPF filter is built
  before `fork` (no async-signal-unsafe allocation in the post-fork child —
  a musl malloc-deadlock risk); MaskedPaths/ReadonlyPaths mounts are idempotent
  (no per-exec mount leak); MaskedPaths/ReadonlyPaths/sysctl names are
  path-traversal validated; plus panic/leak/non-Linux-build fixes.
- `ReopenContainerLog` is now synchronous (waits for the supervisor to reopen the
  log) — correct CRI semantics for log rotation.

### Conformance
- `critest` v1.30.1: 44 of 82 runnable specs pass (up from 21), with no
  regressions. Remaining failures are environmental (registry egress),
  guest-kernel-limited (bridge/mqueue/AppArmor), architectural (mount
  propagation), or test-image artifacts — see `docs/cri-conformance.md`.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- CRI `exec` works end to end over the Kubernetes SPDY/3.1 `remotecommand`
  protocol — `kubectl exec` / `crictl exec` (non-TTY and TTY), stdin, stdout,
  stderr, and exit-code propagation. Implemented in `cri/src/spdy.rs`; the two
  critest exec conformance specs now pass.

### Fixed
- CRI server is now reachable by standard gRPC clients (`crictl`, the kubelet,
  `critest`) over its Unix domain socket. `grpc-go >= 1.57` sends the
  percent-encoded socket path as the HTTP/2 `:authority`, which upstream `h2`
  rejected with a `PROTOCOL_ERROR` stream reset before any CRI RPC ran. A
  vendored `h2` patch (`third_party/h2`, wired via `[patch.crates-io]`) relaxes
  authority validation for UDS-style values; the full pod+container lifecycle
  (`runp`/`create`/`start`/`ps`/`stop`/`rm`/`stopp`/`rmp`) now works end to end.

### Changed
- Split the 7732-line `cri/src/runtime_service.rs` into a focused
  `runtime_service/` module (no behavior change).

## [2.0.4] — 2026-05-09
